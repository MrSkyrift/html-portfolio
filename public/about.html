<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello, my name is Dylan Bryant. I am a Web Developer from Wichita, KS. I live here with my lovely wife. 
  We love to go for bike rides, travel and swim. I personally love music and play video games.</p>

<p>I am rather new to this industry but I have been quite interested in the tech industry for years. 
  I strive to continuously improve in my chosen craft wether by taking online classes or just creating something new daily.
  I hope this has given you an idea of the kind of person and worker I am. If you are interested in learning more or have questions you can contact me <a href="./contact.html">here.</a>
