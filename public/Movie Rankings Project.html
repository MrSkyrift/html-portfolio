    A truly delightful comedy that revolves around a stuntman raising money to save his step fathers life. I have a soft spot for it in my heart. It was a movie that everyone in my family got to enjoy together.

    Such an enjoyable experience. Even more so if you're a fan of the previous Spider-Man movies. It really ties everything together from previous films in a way that will constantly have you smiling.

    Dune is a top tier sci-fi film based off a beloved book seires. The visuals alone could sell anyone on the movie. The only negative being it's the first of two movies so as a stand-alone movie it is incomplete.
